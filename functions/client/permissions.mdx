## Permissions Check Utility

The `hasPermissions` function provides a standardized way to check if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions within the application. It’s especially useful for managing access control based on roles, permissions, and specific layer identifiers.

### Function Definition

```typescript
import useUser from "@/src/app/providers/user-provider/zustand";
import type { Permission } from "@/src/app/types/roles";

export function hasPermissions(
  requiredPermissions: Permission[],
  layerIds?: string | string[],
  needsAllPermissions = false,
) { ... }
```

### Parameters

- **`requiredPermissions`** (`Permission[]`): An array of permissions that the user must have to proceed. This parameter is required and forms the basis of the permission check.
  
- **`layerIds`** (`string | string[]`, optional): Specifies the layers that the user’s roles should correspond to when performing the permission check. If not provided, the check is applied across all layers.

- **`needsAllPermissions`** (`boolean`, default `false`): A flag indicating whether the user must have *all* of the required permissions (`true`) or at least *one* of the permissions (`false`).

### How It Works

1. **Superadmin Check**: If the user is a superadmin, the function automatically returns `true`, granting access.
   
2. **Permission Requirements**:
   - If **`needsAllPermissions`** is `true`, the function checks if the user has every permission listed in `requiredPermissions`.
   - If `needsAllPermissions` is `false`, it only checks if the user has at least one of the `requiredPermissions`.
   
3. **Layer Filtering**: When `layerIds` is provided, the function limits the check to roles that match the given `layerIds`. This ensures permissions are evaluated within specified layers only.

### Return Value

- Returns **`true`** if the user meets the specified permissions and layer requirements.
- Returns **`false`** if the user lacks the necessary permissions or if conditions are not met.

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Permission Check

To check if the user has any of the `["READ", "WRITE"]` permissions:

```typescript
const hasReadOrWriteAccess = hasPermissions(["READ", "WRITE"]);
```

#### All Permissions Check

To check if the user has both `["READ", "WRITE"]` permissions across all layers:

```typescript
const hasFullAccess = hasPermissions(["READ", "WRITE"], undefined, true);
```

#### Layer-Specific Permissions Check

To check if the user has the `["READ"]` permission within specific layers `["layer1", "layer2"]`:

```typescript
const hasLayerSpecificReadAccess = hasPermissions(["READ"], ["layer1", "layer2"]);
```

### Notes
- **Superadmin Access**: Users with the `isSuperadmin` flag are granted automatic access, bypassing permission checks.
- **Layer Filtering**: If `layerIds` are provided, only roles matching these layers are considered.
- **Performance**: This function leverages efficient array methods to quickly evaluate permissions, ensuring minimal performance impact.

This utility simplifies permission management by allowing developers to configure access checks flexibly across various roles and layers.
