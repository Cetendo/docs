## **Overview**

This set of components leverages the `@radix-ui/react-accordion` primitive to create a fully customizable, accessible, and reusable accordion UI. The accordion includes features like collapsible sections, smooth animations, and an interactive trigger icon using the `ChevronDownIcon`.

## **Usage**

```tsx
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent } from '@/src/app/ui/accordion';

function FAQSection() {
  return (
    <Accordion type="single" collapsible>
      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>What is your return policy?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          <p>Our return policy lasts 30 days...</p>
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem value="item-2">
        <AccordionTrigger>How do I track my order?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          <p>You can track your order by...</p>
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  );
}

```

## **API**

### **Accordion**

The `Accordion` component wraps all the items and controls how many sections can be open simultaneously.

- **Props**:
    - `type`: `"single"` | `"multiple"` - Defines if one or multiple items can be open at the same time.
    - `collapsible?`: `boolean` - Allows all items to be collapsed. Useful for single-type accordions.

---

### **AccordionItem**

The `AccordionItem` represents each collapsible section within the accordion.

- **Props**:
    - `value`: `string` - A unique value that identifies the item, required for controlling the open/close state.

---

### **AccordionTrigger**

The `AccordionTrigger` acts as the clickable header that expands/collapses the associated content. It also displays a `ChevronDownIcon` that rotates based on the open/close state.

- **Props**:
    - `children`: `React.ReactNode` - The content of the trigger, typically the title or question.
    - `className?`: `string` - Additional styles for the trigger.

---

### **AccordionContent**

The `AccordionContent` holds the content revealed when the `AccordionTrigger` is activated.

- **Props**:
    - `children`: `React.ReactNode` - The content to be displayed when the accordion item is open.
    - `className?`: `string` - Additional styles for the content.

---

## **Animations**

The accordion supports smooth animations for the content:

- **Opening animation**: Defined by the `data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down` class.
- **Closing animation**: Defined by the `data-[state=closed]:animate-accordion-up` class.

These classes allow for CSS animations that trigger when the accordion opens and closes.

## **Example: Customized Accordion**

```tsx
function CustomAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordion type="multiple">
      <AccordionItem value="custom-1">
        <AccordionTrigger className="text-lg font-bold">Custom Header</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent className="bg-gray-100 text-gray-800">
          <p>This is custom content inside an accordion.</p>
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  );
}

```

In this example, the accordion's trigger and content have custom styles, demonstrating the flexibility of the component with `clsx` for conditional styling.
