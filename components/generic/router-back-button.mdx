## Overview

The `RouterBackButton` component is a specialized button designed to navigate back in the browser history when clicked. It extends the functionality of our standard [Button](https://www.notion.so/Button-1112946d7033804894aae190bc6633bf?pvs=21)  component by predefining the `onClick` event to trigger the `router.back()` method from Next.js.

## Usage

The `RouterBackButton` is used similarly to our standard `Button` component but is specifically tailored for navigation purposes. It simplifies the process of adding a back button to your application by encapsulating the `onClick` logic.

### Props

- `className` (optional): Custom CSS classes to style the button.
- `buttonProps`: Props to customize the button's appearance and behavior, derived from `buttonVariants`.
- `children` (optional): The content to be displayed inside the button.

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```tsx
import { RouterBackButton } from "@/components/router-back-button";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <RouterBackButton variant="default" size="default">
    Go Back
  </RouterBackButton>
);

```

### Example 2: Custom Styling

```tsx
import { RouterBackButton } from "@/components/router-back-button";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <RouterBackButton
    className="custom-class"
    variant="cta" 
    size="lg"
  >
    Back to Previous Page
  </RouterBackButton>
);

```

## Notes

- The `RouterBackButton` is a convenient way to implement a back navigation button without manually handling the `onClick` event.
- It leverages the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to navigate back in the browser history.
