**Props:** 
Our Skeleton component takes two props that give you the power to tailor it to your app's needs:

- `specialColor`: This optional prop allows you to override the default background and accent colors with a custom color of your choice. Think of it as a special sauce that adds an extra layer of flavor to your loading state.
- `className`: This prop lets you add custom tailwind classes to the component, giving you even more control over its styling and behavior.

**Example Usages: Putting it All Together**
Here are a couple of examples to get you started:

### Example 1: Simple Skeleton

```jsx
<Skeleton />

```

This will render a basic Skeleton component with default colors and styling. It's like a blank canvas waiting for your content to arrive.

### Example 2: Custom Rectangle Skeleton

```jsx
<Skeleton className="h-3 w-8 rounded-md" />

```

In this example, we're creating a Skeleton with a height of 3rem, width of 8rem, a gray background, and rounded corners. It's like a custom-made loading state that fits your app's style.

### Example 3: Circle Skeleton

```jsx
<Skeleton className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full" />

```

Here, we're creating a circular Skeleton with a diameter of 8rem, a gray background, and a fully rounded shape. It's like a loading state that's both futuristic and mesmerizing!
