## Overview

The `DurationSelector` component provides a way to select a duration (in minutes) using an `AsyncSelect` dropdown. It includes preset durations, as well as support for custom input, allowing users to specify hours and minutes in different formats.

## Usage

```tsx
import DurationSelector from '@/src/app/components/duration-selector';

function MyComponent() {
  const [duration, setDuration] = useState(60);

  return (
    <DurationSelector value={duration} onChange={setDuration}>
      <button>Choose Duration</button>
    </DurationSelector>
  );
}

```

## API

### Props

- **`value: number`**
    
    The selected duration in minutes.
    
- **`onChange: (value: number) => void`**
    
    Callback function that is triggered when a new duration is selected.
    
- **`children?: React.ReactNode`**
    
    Optional custom trigger for the dropdown. If not provided, a default button will be used.
    

## Features

1. **Preset Durations**: Includes predefined durations like 15, 30, 60, 120 minutes, etc.
2. **Custom Input**: Allows users to enter durations manually in minutes or in "hours minutes" format.
3. **Dynamic Search**: Filters the available durations based on user input.
4. **Language Support**: Formats durations based on the user's language (e.g., "hours" in English, "Stunden" in German).
5. **Limit on Maximum Duration**: If a duration exceeds 1440 minutes (24 hours), it will be capped at 1440.

### Example: Custom Trigger

```tsx
<DurationSelector value={duration} onChange={setDuration}>
  <button className="custom-trigger">Pick a Duration</button>
</DurationSelector>

```

In this example, the custom button will act as the trigger for opening the `AsyncSelect` dropdown.

### Placeholder Durations

The component includes preset durations such as 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., which are generated based on the user's language:

```
const placeholderDurations = [
  { label: formatPlaceholderDuration(15), value: 15 },
  { label: formatPlaceholderDuration(30), value: 30 },
  { label: formatPlaceholderDuration(60), value: 60 },
  { label: formatPlaceholderDuration(120), value: 120 },
];

```

These durations are displayed by default when the component is initialized.

### Dynamic Formatting Based on Language

The `formatDuration` and `formatPlaceholderDuration` functions automatically adjust the duration labels based on the user's language:

```
const formatDuration = (hours, minutes) => {
  const hoursText = hours ? `${hours} ${hours === 1 ? "hour" : "hours"}` : "";
  const minutesText = minutes ? `${minutes} min` : "";
  return `${hoursText} ${minutesText}`.trim();
};

```

This ensures that durations are presented in a format that matches the user's locale.

### Search Input and Filtering

The component supports custom search queries, allowing users to type specific durations. For instance, typing "1 30" will return both "1 hour 30 minutes" and "90 minutes":

```
const fetchDurations = async (): Promise<DurationItem[]> => {
  if (!searchTerm) {
    return placeholderDurations;
  }

  // Handle search term and filter durations accordingly
  if (!isNaN(parseInt(searchTerm, 10)) || searchTerm.includes(" ")) {
    return convertInputToDuration(searchTerm);
  }

  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  return durations.filter((duration) =>
    duration.label.toLowerCase().startsWith(searchLower),
  );
};

```

This component provides a flexible, multilingual way to select durations with search and custom input support, making it suitable for scheduling and appointment-related interfaces.
