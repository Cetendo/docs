Understand [Permissions and Roles //TODO](https://www.notion.so/Permissions-and-Roles-1142946d7033808c9551e3056b2b5413?pvs=21) first before reading this

Unlike the [Protect](/components/auth/protect)  component, which hides components based on permissions, the `AccessProvider` component simply passes the access information downwards the component tree.

### Props

The AccessProvider component takes in three props:

- `layerIds`?: A string or array of strings representing the layer IDs to check against the user's permissions.
- `permissions`: An array of `Permission` objects that define what the user needs to access the feature or resource.
- `children`: A function that takes a single prop `hasAccess` (a boolean indicating whether the user has access) and returns a React node. This is where the magic happens â€“ if the user has access, the node is rendered; otherwise, it's not!

Unlike the [Protect](/components/auth/protect)  component, which hides components based on permissions, the `AccessProvider` component simply passes the access information downwards the component tree.

Example could be using it to conditionally render a menu item:

```jsx
import AccessProvider from './AccessProvider';

const MyMenuItem = () => {
  return (
    <AccessProvider
      layerIds={['123', '456']} // optional
      permissions={["read:something"]}
    >
      {({ hasAccess }) => (hasAccess ?
        <MenuItem>View Profile</MenuItem> :
        <div>Cannot view</div>
      )}
    </AccessProvider>
  );
};

```

In this case, the menu item is only rendered if the user has the `read:something` permission in the `user` or `guest` layer.
