A PR review is divided into two parts. The first part involves understanding the task at hand, whether it's a feature, bug, chore, or something else, and checking if there is anything to test in the preview. The second parts is all about code health, making sure to the code meets a scalable and readable standard.

For instance, if a coder was asked to fix a problem or build a button, it should be tested using the preview link.

Even when the task involves only refactoring, it's crucial to test the affected features.

# 1. Checking if task requirements have been met

Understanding the implications for the frontend/backend is essential for all tasks.

Take, for example, a task that requires a new blue button. You should expect to see a blue button in the preview loom AND in the testing of the preview link.

You should check tasks in the following order.

### Review the preview loom provided by the developer

Each task should include a preview loom. If it doesn't, change the task status to "changes requested" and comment that a preview loom is missing. Steps below don’t need to be taken until there is a loom. (To safe your time)

### Review the preview link:

Not all tasks require reviewing the link. In some cases, small features do not necessitate examining the link. For instance, translation fixes or minor UI tasks can be verified by just checking the loom. However, tasks that involve more file changes, such as five or more, should be tested using the preview link.

Once you successfully watched the loom and tested the preview link (if applicable) and verified that the task indeed has met the requirements, you can move on to the code review.

We perform the code review as a second step because reviewing anything before we have a satisfactory result for the task is not efficient. We only fine-tune the code once we're certain that the feature or bug fix works as expected.

# 2. Code review

Now that the task works as expected we make sure the code is up to standard. 

Code must apply to: [Code Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Code-Guidelines-e1616ec8d671478392c2add36881ffd4?pvs=21) 

If the PR doesn't adhere to the code guidelines, comment on GitHub, request changes, and set the task status back to 'change requested’ with a comment on the task that there is a code review on GitHub.

## 3. Merge

Yay, if you are here, everything is fine and we can merge the feature. Once you merged on github, you can delete the branch.
