- Wait for your branch to generate a preview link on Vercel before creating a PR.
- Once the preview link is available, visit it and record a Loom video of your current feature (note: storage and Stripe-related features won't work on the preview, record them locally instead).
- Include this Loom video at the end of your task.
- Double-check that you have completed all requests of your ticket before creating a PR to the `dev` branch.

- Every task has a Task ID. When naming your PR, use the following format:

```tsx
[YOUR_TASK_ID] feat / description
[YOUR_TASK_ID] fix / description
...

```

![You can find the task id on the attributes list of your task](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c287c3f-0b82-488b-bc08-312929473139/f6e38cc9-93c7-4668-9509-dd010d67c146/CleanShot_2024-04-03_at_15.57.08.png)

You can find the task id on the attributes list of your task

Including your task id in the PR will automatically link it to your Notion task and update the status to: For review (you won't see the ticket on your list anymore at this point).
