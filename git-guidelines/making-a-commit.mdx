<Warning>
    Only commit via the Git-CLI / Terminal, since we have a type checking and test running script running before your commits. Same for pushing.

    **Category**

    A commit message should start with a category of change. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, and `hotfix`.

    - `feat` is for adding a new feature.
    - `fix` is for fixing a bug.
    - `refactor` is for changing code for performance or convenience purpose (e.g. readability).
    - `chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc).
    - `hotfix` is for quickly addressing issues in production code.

    After the category, there should be a "`:`" announcing the commit description.

    **Description(s)**

    After the colon, the commit description should consist in short statements describing the changes.

    Each statement should start with a verb conjugated in an imperative way. Statements should be seperated from themselves with a "`;`".


    **To sum up, follow this pattern when committing:**

    ```
    git commit -m '<category: do something; do some other things>'

    ```

    **Examples:**

    - `git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add new button components to templates'`
    - `git commit -m 'fix: add the stop directive to button component to prevent propagation'`
    - `git commit -m 'refactor: rewrite button component in TypeScript'`
    - `git commit -m 'chore: write button documentation'`
