**Category**

A git branch should start with a category. You can pretty much use the following 4 categories for everything: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, and `hotfix`.

- `feat` is for adding a new feature.
- `fix` is for fixing a bug.
- `refactor` is for changing code for performance or convenience purpose (e.g. readability).
- `chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc).
- `hotfix` is for quickly addressing issues in production code.

**Description**

After the category, there should be another "`/`" followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased". By default, you can use the title of the issue/ticket you are working on. Just replace any special character by "`-`".


**Examples**

- `feature/add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/fix-login-validation`
- `hotfix/update-database-credentials`
- `test/experiment-with-new-ui`
