We currently have five priority levels:

**Hotfix, High, Medium, Low, No priority**

When choosing your next task, make sure to follow these priorities. If you're already working on a task and receive a higher priority one, you don't need to stop your current task. Continue with it, finish it, and then move on to the next highest priority task. The only exception is a hotfix. If you receive a hotfix, save your current work and begin working on the hotfix immediately.
