## To-do

Tickets in the To-do category have not yet been started.

**Planning:** The task lead is currently preparing your ticket. You can view it, but cannot start work on it.

**On hold:** If your task is marked with this status, it is currently paused and should not be continued.

**Not started:** Your ticket is ready for work. Start coding when you're ready!

## In progress

These are the tickets you've started but have not yet completed or merged.

**In progress:** Mark your task as 'In progress' when you begin working on a ticket. This is crucial.

**For review:** If your ticket requires a PR and you've followed the [PR Guidelines](/git-guidelines/making-a-pr), it should automatically be set for review. If your task doesn't require a PR, you need to set this status yourself to signal the task lead to review your work.

**Changes requested:** Don't worry if this happens. A task lead has reviewed your work and requested some changes. Implement these changes and set the task back to 'For review.'

**Blocked:** If you're unable to continue with a task, set its status to 'Blocked.' This could be due to unresolved questions, conflicts, or any other issues. Ensure you add a comment to the top of the ticket page and detail any obstacles preventing you from continuing (you can use looms if needed).

A task lead will respond to you as soon as possible. However, this may still take some time. In the meantime, please proceed with the next ticket in the priority hierarchy.

**Block resolved:** Hurray! You got answers to your questions by a task lead. This task is now unblocked and you can continue working on it.

## Complete

A status in the complete category is being set by task leads only. No need to worry about them, they will just sort the tasks into our changelogs.
