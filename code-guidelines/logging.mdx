To ensure effective error tracking and event logging, we use Sentry in combination with a custom abstraction layer. This abstraction simplifies logging across your codebase, encourages the **Single Responsibility Principle**, and enhances debugging and performance analysis.

## Why an Abstraction Layer?


<Accordion title="The reason for creating an abstraction layer">
  When using Sentry, logging actions such as tracking UI clicks requires verbose syntax. Here's an example using Sentry directly:

  ```tsx
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: "ui.click",
    message: "User clicked the button",
    level: "info",
  });
  ```

  With our abstraction, the same task is simplified:

  ```tsx
  log.click("User clicked the button");
  ```

  This abstraction layer reduces boilerplate code, increases clarity, and helps developers focus on core functionality while maintaining comprehensive logging.

## Logging Functions Overview

Here are the key logging functions provided by our abstraction, each with a specific use case. These should be used throughout your code to ensure clear and helpful logging.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="timespan: Tracking Performance">
    Tracks the duration of an operation and logs it as a breadcrumb. This is useful for monitoring function performance and identifying slow transactions.

    ```tsx
    const user = log.timespan("Get User", () => {
      return getUser();
    });
    ```

    The `timespan` function logs the time taken for the operation and provides insights in Sentry's performance tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="context: Capturing Contextual Information">
    Attaches structured data to events, which helps debug errors by providing context about the initial conditions.

    ```tsx
    log.context("User", { userId: "12345", name: "Martin Magiclord" });
    ```

    This is particularly useful at the beginning of API calls or complex operations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="click: Logging UI Click Events">
    Records a UI click event with optional additional data, helping track user interactions.

    ```tsx
    log.click("Submit button clicked", { buttonId: "submit-button" });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="response: Logging Network Responses">
    Logs network responses, including status and URL, to aid in debugging network-related issues.

    ```tsx
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    log.response(response);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="info: Logging Informational Events">
    Logs general informational events with optional additional data. Use this to record significant non-error events.

    ```tsx
    log.info("User logged in", { userId: "12345" });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="warn: Logging Warnings">
    Logs a warning message with optional additional data. Warnings indicate potential issues that may require attention but aren't yet critical errors.

    ```tsx
    log.warn("Low disk space", { availableSpace: "2GB" });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="error: Logging Errors">
    Logs errors with an optional context message. This is crucial for capturing and reporting errors in both development and production.

    ```tsx
    try {
      riskyFunction();
    } catch (error) {
      log.error("Error during risky function execution", error);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debug Mode and Error Handling in Non-Production Environments

In non-production environments (such as development or staging), errors are logged, but they may not trigger full Sentry captures unless explicitly required.

- **Non-Production**: Errors are logged using `log.error`, but they do not send a full report to Sentry unless necessary.
- **Production**: All errors are captured and sent to Sentry for analysis.

This ensures minimal noise during development while maintaining comprehensive logging in production.

## Example Usage in Frontend and Backend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Frontend Example">
    Here's how to log actions and errors in the frontend:

    ```tsx
    import { log } from "@/src/app/functions/log";

    export function CreateUserButton() {
      async function createUser() {
        log.timespan("Create User", async () => {
          log.click("Create User button clicked");

          try {
            const response = await fetch("/create/user");
            if (!response.ok) {
              log.warn("HTTP error during user creation", {
                status: response.status,
                statusText: response.statusText,
              });
              throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
            }

            log.info("User created successfully");
          } catch (error) {
            log.error("Error creating user", error);
          }
        });
      }

      return <button onClick={createUser}>Create User</button>;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backend Example">
    Here's an example of logging actions and errors in the backend:

    ```tsx
    import { log } from "@/src/app/functions/log";

    export default async function handler(req, res) {
      log.timespan("Create Institution Room", async () => {
        try {
          log.context("Request", { method: req.method, body: req.body });
          
          // Business logic here...
          log.info("Successfully created institution room");

          res.status(200).json({ message: "Success" });
        } catch (error) {
          log.error("Error creating institution room", error);
          res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
        }
      });
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
