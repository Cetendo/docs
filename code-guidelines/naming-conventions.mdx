**File Names**

Our file names in general are in **kebab-case** and not in camel-case. 

<Tip>
It is also crucial to understand [**Colocation**](/code-guidelines/colocations) to ensure these files not only have appropriate names but are also sorted correctly.

**Common files**

In our file structure, you'll find files that are needed frequently. To keep the structure clean and readable, we aim to streamline their naming.

| **File / Folder Purpose** | **Recommended Name** |
| --- | --- |
| Storing a single FE/BE function | *your-function-name*.ts |
| Storing a single nextjs server action | *your-action-name*.ts |
| Storing a singe hook | *use-your-hook*.ts |
| Storing a single type | *your-single-type*.types.ts |
| Storing a single const | *your-single-const.*const.ts |
| Storing a zustand state | zustand.ts |
| Storing multiple FE/BE functions | functions.ts |
| Storing multiple nextjs server actions  | actions.ts |
| Files for storing types | *name*.types.ts |
| Storing hooks | hooks.ts |
| Storing many consts | *name*.const.ts |
| Folder for keeping components and sub components for a page or component | /components |
| A component file | *your-component*.tsx |
| Storing functions for api calls | functions.ts |
| Storing a single function for api calls | *your-function-name*.ts |

*Gray and italic* text is supposed to be replaced by a fitting name. 

It is crucial to understand [**Colocation**](/code-guidelines/colocations) to ensure these files not only have appropriate names but are also sorted correctly.

**Translation tags**

Always use kebab-case for translation tags.
