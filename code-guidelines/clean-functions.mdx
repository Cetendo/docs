1. Name functions descriptively so that developers can understand their purpose at a glance.
2. Keep functions concise and focused on a single task, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle** (**SRP**) - Read [Long Method](https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-method) for more
3. Place functions in the appropriate location within the codebase (read the [**Colocation**](/code-guidelines/colocations)  guide for best practices).
4. Implement proper error handling and logging within functions to enhance debugging and monitoring. 
5. Use descriptive parameter names and consider adding JSDoc comments for better function documentation.

### The perfect function

```tsx
export function doSomething(data: CoolType) {
  try {
    // always log the function at the beginning so we have better
    // tracability for errors
    log.info("We are doing something...", { data });
    // your code
  } catch (error) {
    log.error("Doing something went wrong...", error);
    // additional work like returning or re throwing
  }
}
```
