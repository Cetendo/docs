Writing clean and maintainable React components is crucial for long-term scalability and readability. This document outlines the best practices to follow while developing components using the **Next.js App Router** and **Clean Code** principles.

## Key Principles of Clean Components

When creating React components, adhering to certain principles helps maintain structure, readability, and testability. Below are the core principles:

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- A component should do **one thing** and do it well.
- Avoid mixing unrelated concerns (e.g., UI logic, data fetching, and business logic) in a single component.
  
### 2. **Component Structure**
- **Only one component per file**. Each file should export a single component, unless you're working with small, reusable helpers or subcomponents.
- **Folder structure** should mirror the component hierarchy for clarity and modularity.
- **Colocation:** Ensure that your component-related files (styles, types, tests, etc.) are colocated within the same folder as the component itself for better maintainability. You can refer to the [Colocations](/code-guidelines/colocations) guide for more details on how to structure and colocate your files efficiently.

### 3. **Break Down Large Components**
- Extract components when:
  - It becomes harder to understand the composition of the current component because of subcomponents.
  - The component grows too large (typically over 100 lines) or becomes hard to read.
- **Naming** plays a vital role in breaking components. Good names allow developers to easily understand the component's responsibility and how it fits into the larger system.

For example, break this large component:
```tsx
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav className="sidebar">
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Settings</li>
          <li>Profile</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <main className="content">
        <section className="overview">
          <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard</h1>
          <p>Here you can manage your profile, settings, and view statistics.</p>
        </section>
        <section className="stats">
          <h2>Your Stats</h2>
          <p>Profile Views: 1,234</p>
          <p>Messages: 56</p>
        </section>
      </main>
      <footer className="footer">
        <p>Â© 2024 My Dashboard. All rights reserved.</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Into smaller ones:

```tsx
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Sidebar />
      <MainContent />
      <DashboardFooter />
    </div>
  );
}
```
4. Error Boundaries

    Use the ErrorBoundary component from React or a custom one to gracefully handle errors. Wrap components that deal with complex business logic or rely heavily on external APIs.

Example:

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@/src/app/components/ErrorBoundary';

function ProductPage() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
      <ProductDetails />
      <Recommendations />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```
5. Functional, Declarative Components

    Use functional components and hooks. Avoid class components unless absolutely necessary. Prefer declarative programming to make the UI logic more readable and predictable.

Declarative:

```tsx
const UserProfile = () => (
  <div>
    <UserAvatar />
    <UserInfo />
  </div>
);
```
Imperative (not recommended):

```tsx
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <UserAvatar />
        <UserInfo />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

6. Props Management

    Use descriptive prop names to make your components reusable and intuitive. If a component has many props, consider grouping them into an object.

Bad:

```tsx
<MyComponent title="Title" name="John" age={25} />
```
Good:

```tsx
<MyComponent user={{ name: 'John', age: 25 }} title="Title" />
```
    Use TypeScript to define Prop Types for better type safety and IntelliSense.

Example:

```tsx
type UserProfileProps = {
  user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
};

const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ user, isLoggedIn }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <h2>{user.name}</h2> : <p>Please log in</p>}
    </div>
  );
};
```
7. Reusability and Composition

    Build small, reusable components that can be composed into larger ones. Ensure components are stateless if possible, and handle state at the top-most component or via hooks.

Good Reusability Example:

```tsx
const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
);

const LoginForm = () => (
  <form>
    <Input type="text" />
    <Input type="password" />
    <Button label="Login" />
  </form>
);
```
8. State and Side Effects

    Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for managing component state and side effects. Keep logic that modifies state separate from UI logic to maintain clarity.

Example of separating concerns with custom hooks:

```tsx
function useUser() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUser() {
      const response = await getUser();
      setUser(response);
    }
    fetchUser();
  }, []);

  return user;
}

const UserProfile = () => {
  const user = useUser();
  
  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
};
```
