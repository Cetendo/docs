title: 'Using server-only and client-only'
description: ''

When building a Next.js application, it's important to ensure that server-side and client-side code are properly separated. This is where the `server-only` and `client-only` packages come in handy.
    
### Using `server-only`
    
Import `server-only` at the top of any file that contains server-side functionality. If you now import anything from this file in a client file, it will throw and error.
    
```jsx
import 'server-only';
    
const myServerFunction = () => {
  // Server-side logic goes here
  return 'This will only run on the server';
});
    
```
    
Use `server-only` for:
    
- API routes
- Database interactions
- Sensitive business logic
    
### Using `client-only`
    
Import `client-only` at the top of any file that contains client-side functionality. If you now import this into a server based file, it will throw an error.
    
```jsx
import 'client-only';
    
const myClientFunction = () => {
  // Client-side logic goes here
  return 'This will only run on the client';
};
    
```
    
Use `client-only` for:
    
- Browser-specific APIs (e.g., `window`, `document`)
- Client-side state management
- UI-specific logic

    
By using both `server-only` and `client-only`, you can ensure that your server-side and client-side code are properly isolated and secure.
