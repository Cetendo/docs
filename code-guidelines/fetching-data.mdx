## On the Client Side

In our frontend, we use **React Query** as our standardized way to fetch data. This approach ensures consistency and leverages React Queryâ€™s features like caching, retries, and background refetching to keep data up-to-date efficiently.

### Basic Usage of `useQuery`

Our data-fetching pattern with React Query usually follows this structure:

```javascript
const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["unique-query-key"],
  queryFn: fetchFunction,  // Function to perform the API call
});
```

Here are some common examples for fetching "user-course" data:

### Examples

#### 1. Fetching User Data Fields

```javascript
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["user-course-fields"],
  queryFn: getUserCourseFields,
});
```

This query fetches essential fields for the user-course data using the `getUserCourseFields` function, which retrieves information needed for initial display.

#### 2. Fetching Course Status and Subscription Data

```javascript
const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["course-status-subscription"],
  queryFn: () => getCourseStatusAndSubscription(),
});
```

This query provides both loading and error states while fetching course status and subscription data. This is useful when different states (like `isLoading` and `isError`) are needed for conditional UI rendering.

#### 3. Fetching Course Layers

```javascript
const { data: courseLayers } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["course-layers"],
  queryFn: getCourseLayers,
});
```

Here, we fetch additional "layers" of the course (for instance, related course sections or modules) using `getCourseLayers`. We assign the result to `courseLayers` for easy reference.

### Key Points

- **React Query**: This is our standard approach to data fetching on the frontend.
- **queryKey**: Unique identifier for caching each specific data request.
- **queryFn**: The function responsible for the API call.
