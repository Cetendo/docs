- Only have 1 component per file.
- Extract components when:
    - it becomes harder to understand the composition of the current component because of the subcomponent (good component naming allows looking at a component file and immediately understanding what is happening and how itâ€™s put together)
    - the current component simply becomes too large
- Use our `ErrorBoundary` component to wrap your components if they have a lot of purposes or children.
