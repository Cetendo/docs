Your code must be logged properly. We are using sentry for our logging and wrote and abstraction on top of it. Since you are strictly applying **Single Responsibility Principle** it is recommended that each function has a least one info log in it. Functions should include more logging at each step tho as well as a try catch logic. Read [Clean Functions](https://www.notion.so/Clean-Functions-ff925cf183264698b966509811a21437?pvs=21) for more.

We have Sentry under the hood for event logging and error capturing. However, we've created our own abstraction over it to minimize boilerplate code.

- **The reason for creating an abstraction layer**
    
    When examining Sentry code, for example, the breadcrumbs for UI click
    
    ```tsx
    Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
      category: "ui.click",
      message: "User clicked the button",
      level: "info",
    });
    
    ```
    
    and comparing it to our abstraction code
    
    ```tsx
    log.click("User clicked the button")
    ```
    
    You'll see that we greatly reduce boilerplate by creating more functions in the abstractions.
    
    We have `log.info` for normal logs, `log.warn`, `log.click`, and much more. This significantly reduces unnecessary repetition and keeps our code clean.
    

Our logging abstraction layer includes several functions. Utilize these when coding to enhance future development experiences and aid in bug fixing related to your current code.
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="timespan">
    
    Tracks the duration of a transaction and adds a breadcrumb. This aids in better comprehension of function performance and pinpointing areas of slowdown.
    
    ```tsx
    // Now we can look in Sentry in the "performance" tab and see how this
    // function / transaction is running for our users. 
    // This will help us identify transactions that are slow.
    const user = log.timespan("Get User", () => {
      // Simulate a database query operation
      return getUser();
    });
    // Tip: The return type of the timespan function will be equal to the return
    // type of the function you added.
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="context">
    
    The `context` function sets a custom context in Sentry that allows us to attach structured data to events. It's especially useful to include this at the start of functions and API calls, as it aids in understanding the initial conditions when debugging.
    
    ```tsx
    // now we know the initial conditions when looking at a bug
    // helping us understand it.
    log.context("User", { userId: "12345", name: "Martin Magiclord" });
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="click">
    
    Records a UI click event as a breadcrumb (you can add additional data about the event). This is useful for tracking user interactions within the application's interface and understanding user behavior.
    
    ```tsx
    // the data object is optional but can be provided to
    // help developers understand certain conditions
    log.click("Button clicked", { buttonId: "submit-button" });
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="response">
    
    Logs a network response as a breadcrumb, including status and URL information. This function is valuable for monitoring network activity within the application, aiding in debugging and performance optimization.
    
    ```tsx
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    // the response will be added as a breadcrumb
    // with all necessary data frok that reponse
    log.response(response);
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="info">
    
    Logs a generic informational event with an optional data payload. This function is suitable for logging general information about the application's state or behavior, providing context for debugging and analysis.
    
    ```tsx
    // the data object is optional but can be provided to
    // help developers understand certain conditions
    log.info("Event happened", { data: "your cool data", more_data: "really cool" });
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="warn">
    
    Logs a warning message with an optional data payload. Warnings indicate potential issues or unexpected behavior that may require attention but do not necessarily result in an error. This function helps in identifying and addressing issues before they escalate.
    
    ```tsx
    // the data object is optional but can be provided to
    // help developers understand certain conditions
    log.warn("Event happened", { data: "your cool data", more_data: "really cool" });
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="error">
    
    Captures an error event in Sentry, optionally with an additional message for context. This function is crucial for tracking and managing errors within the application, facilitating troubleshooting and resolution of issues encountered by users.
    
    ```tsx
    try {
      // Code that may throw an error
      riskyFunction();
    } catch (error) {
      log.error(error, "Error occurred during data processing");
    }
    ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

By incorporating the tools mentioned above, we can create transparent functions and components. This approach improves our understanding of user behavior, bugs, errors, and bottlenecks. 

### **Examples of perfectly integrated logging:**

The logger works perfectly find in both frontend and backend.

    <Accordion title="Frontend">
    
    ```tsx
    import { log } from "@/src/utils/logger/logger";

        log.timespan("Create User", async () => {
          try {
            // Log the button click with log.click
            log.click('Create User button clicked');
