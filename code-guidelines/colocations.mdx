<Tip>
It’s also important to understand our [Naming conventions](https://www.notion.so/Naming-conventions-bb45e02432b9448f9f9dd38f5716278d?pvs=21) to not just sort the files right, but also name them correctly!

</Tip>

We want things to be close to where they are used, and colocation helps with that. If you have a page that uses components, you should place the components folder inside the page folder. This approach is natural and makes things easier to find.

```jsx
/ dashboard 
- / users
  - /components // components that are just used in the users page
  - functions.ts // functions that are just used in the users page
  - actions.ts // actions for that page / component
  - users.types.ts // Any types related to the component - scroll down for more
	- page.tsx
- / courses // each page gets it's own folder - with the things it uses inside
	- ...
- functions.ts // if there are functions shared by these pages, you can create
               // functions file higher up the hierachy. But not too high up
               // only on the level shared by the entities that use its functions

...
/api
	- /get-items
		- functions.ts // colocate the functions of an api route in the same folder
									 // if functions are used in other places to put them in 
									 // src/app/functions/server
		- route.ts
	- /get-user
		- get-user.ts  // you can name the file after the function for easier
									 // search if the file has just one function
		- route.ts
```

Use these axioms to place your files:

1. **Axiom of Usage Proximity:** Place components and functions as close as possible to where they are used to enhance accessibility and discoverability.
2. **Axiom of Page-Centric Organization:** Each page should have its own folder containing all components and functions that are exclusive to it, promoting modularity and easy maintenance.
3. **Axiom of Shared Logic Placement:** Shared components or functions should be placed at the nearest common ancestor in the directory hierarchy, avoiding unnecessary complexity and coupling.

## Exceptions

**Types**

If types are used anywhere else outside of the respective component / page, do not move them up to the next shared position in the file hierarchy. Move them into the `src/app/types` . As soon as a type is shared it is to be put into that folder.

**Generic UI elements**

Elements that are highly reusable and useless on their own, like a button or tooltip is to be put in the `src/app/ui` folder. Components that are used across the software and do have a purpose on their own are to be put in the `src/app/components` folder.
