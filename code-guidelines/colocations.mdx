</Tip>

We want things to be close to where they are used, and colocation helps with that. If you have a page that uses components, you should place the components folder inside the page folder. This approach is natural and makes things easier to find.

```jsx
/dashboard
├── /users
│   ├── /components        // Components that are just used in the users pagepage
│   ├── functions.ts       // Functions that are just used on the users page
│   ├── actions.ts         // Actions for the page/component
│   ├── users.types.ts     // Any types related to the component
│   └── page.tsx           
├── /courses               // Each page gets its own folder with the things it uses inside
│   └── ...                
├── functions.ts           // functions file higher up the hierachy. But not too high up
               			   // only on the level shared by the entities that use its functions

...
/api
├── /get-items
│   ├── functions.ts       // colocate the functions of an api route in the same folder
│   │                      // if functions are used in other places to put them in 
│   │                      // src/app/functions/server
│   └── route.ts           
├── /get-user
│   ├── get-user.ts        // you can name the file after the function for easier
│   │                      // search if the file has just one function
│   └── route.ts           
```

Use these axioms to place your files:

1. **Axiom of Usage Proximity:** Place components and functions as close as possible to where they are used to enhance accessibility and discoverability.
2. **Axiom of Page-Centric Organization:** Each page should have its own folder containing all components and functions that are exclusive to it, promoting modularity and easy maintenance.
3. **Axiom of Shared Logic Placement:** Shared components or functions should be placed at the nearest common ancestor in the directory hierarchy, avoiding unnecessary complexity and coupling.

## Exceptions

**Types**

If types are used anywhere else outside of the respective component / page, do not move them up to the next shared position in the file hierarchy. Move them into the `src/app/types` . As soon as a type is shared it is to be put into that folder.

**Generic UI elements**

Elements that are highly reusable and useless on their own, like a button or tooltip is to be put in the `src/app/ui` folder. Components that are used across the software and do have a purpose on their own are to be put in the `src/app/components` folder.
