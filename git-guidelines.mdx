  <Accordion title="Create a Branch">
    **Category**

    A git branch should start with a category. You can pretty much use the following 4 categories for everything: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, and `hotfix`.

    - `feat` is for adding a new feature.
    - `fix` is for fixing a bug.
    - `refactor` is for changing code for performance or convenience purpose (e.g. readability).
    - `chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc).
    - `hotfix` is for quickly addressing issues in production code.

    **Description**

    After the category, there should be another "`/`" followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased". By default, you can use the title of the issue/ticket you are working on. Just replace any special character by "`-`".


    **Examples**

  - `feature/add-user-authentication`
  - `bugfix/fix-login-validation`
  - `hotfix/update-database-credentials`
  - `test/experiment-with-new-ui`

  <Accordion title="Making a Commit">
    <Warning>
    Only commit via the Git-CLI / Terminal, since we have a type checking and test running script running before your commits. Same for pushing.
    
    </Warning>

    **Category**

    A commit message should start with a category of change. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, and `hotfix`.

    - `feat` is for adding a new feature.
    - `fix` is for fixing a bug.
    - `refactor` is for changing code for performance or convenience purpose (e.g. readability).
    - `chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc).
    - `hotfix` is for quickly addressing issues in production code.

    After the category, there should be a "`:`" announcing the commit description.

    **Description(s)**

    After the colon, the commit description should consist in short statements describing the changes.

    Each statement should start with a verb conjugated in an imperative way. Statements should be seperated from themselves with a "`;`".


    **To sum up, follow this pattern when committing:**

    ```
    git commit -m '<category: do something; do some other things>'

    ```

    **Examples:**

    - `git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add new button components to templates'`
    - `git commit -m 'fix: add the stop directive to button component to prevent propagation'`
    - `git commit -m 'refactor: rewrite button component in TypeScript'`
    - `git commit -m 'chore: write button documentation'`

  <Accordion title="Making a PR">
    - Wait for your branch to generate a preview link on Vercel before creating a PR.
    - Once the preview link is available, visit it and record a Loom video of your current feature (note: storage and Stripe-related features won't work on the preview, record them locally instead).
    - Include this Loom video at the end of your task.
    - Double-check that you have completed all requests of your ticket before creating a PR to the `dev` branch.

    - Every task has a Task ID. When naming your PR, use the following format:

    ```tsx
    [YOUR_TASK_ID] feat / description
    [YOUR_TASK_ID] fix / description
    ...

    ```

    ![You can find the task id on the attributes list of your task](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c287c3f-0b82-488b-bc08-312929473139/f6e38cc9-93c7-4668-9509-dd010d67c146/CleanShot_2024-04-03_at_15.57.08.png)

    You can find the task id on the attributes list of your task

    Including your task id in the PR will automatically link it to your Notion task and update the status to: For review (you won't see the ticket on your list anymore at this point).

  <Accordion title="Reviewing a PR">
    <Note>
    This page is solely relevant for task leads. If you are not a task lead, this page isn't important for you, and there's no need to read it.

    </Note>

    A PR review is divided into two parts. The first part involves understanding the task at hand, whether it's a feature, bug, chore, or something else, and checking if there is anything to test in the preview. The second parts is all about code health, making sure to the code meets a scalable and readable standard.

    For instance, if a coder was asked to fix a problem or build a button, it should be tested using the preview link.

    Even when the task involves only refactoring, it's crucial to test the affected features.

    # 1. Checking if task requirements have been met

    Understanding the implications for the frontend/backend is essential for all tasks.

    Take, for example, a task that requires a new blue button. You should expect to see a blue button in the preview loom AND in the testing of the preview link.

    You should check tasks in the following order.

    ### Review the preview loom provided by the developer

    Each task should include a preview loom. If it doesn't, change the task status to "changes requested" and comment that a preview loom is missing. Steps below don’t need to be taken until there is a loom. (To safe your time)

    Read more on statuses in [How to: Ticket status](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Ticket-status-adaccc8800da4f4ba4b7dae976ccdef0?pvs=21) 

    ### Review the preview link:

    Not all tasks require reviewing the link. In some cases, small features do not necessitate examining the link. For instance, translation fixes or minor UI tasks can be verified by just checking the loom. However, tasks that involve more file changes, such as five or more, should be tested using the preview link.

    Once you successfully watched the loom and tested the preview link (if applicable) and verified that the task indeed has met the requirements, you can move on to the code review.

    We perform the code review as a second step because reviewing anything before we have a satisfactory result for the task is not efficient. We only fine-tune the code once we're certain that the feature or bug fix works as expected.

    ---

    # 2. Code review

    Now that the task works as expected we make sure the code is up to standard. 

    Code must apply to: [Code Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Code-Guidelines-e1616ec8d671478392c2add36881ffd4?pvs=21) 

    If the PR doesn't adhere to the code guidelines, comment on GitHub, request changes, and set the task status back to 'change requested’ with a comment on the task that there is a code review on GitHub.

    ## 3. Merge

    Yay, if you are here, everything is fine and we can merge the feature. Once you merged on github, you can delete the branch.
